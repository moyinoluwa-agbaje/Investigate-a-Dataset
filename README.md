## Dataset

#### Introduction:

- This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movies Database (TMdb), including user ratings and revenue.

#### Data Source:
The original data files used in for this project are listed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

#### Data Wrangling Steps:

- Statistical Analysis.
- Percentage distribution of genres.
- Relationship between runtime and average vote.
- Correlation between average vote, release year and popularity of movies..

## Summary of Findings

- While working with 'The Movies database ' in this project, I was able to explore the dataset by analyzing qualities and identify the properties associated with popularity of movies.

- After I cleaned the dataset by removing unwanted, null, and duplicated values, I went further to check the columns that have the most right skewness. Also, I inspected the percentage distribution of the genres attribute to establish the genre with the highest percentage. From the pie chart represented, the 'Animation', 'Fantasy' and 'Adventure' respectively had the highest percentages distribution over the year. Other genres such as 'Thriller' and 'History' appeared lesser to become the most popular genre.

Right after the processes above, I checked the relationship between runtime and average vote.

- Finaly, I checked the correlation between average vote, release year and popularity. Higher evenly distribution was noticed with the 'vote_average' column, and this in turn made me plot few charts. From the plotted charts, the most voted movies were released between year 1960 and the 1980s, with popularity rating of 0 and 5 with progrssing mid-high vote

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Removing unwanted columns off the table for better exploration and analysis. Also, the last two columns with '_adj' will be adjusted to avoid possible mixup or confusion.
- Column(s) have right skewness.
- Percentage distribution of genres.
- Relationship between runtime and average vote.
- Correlation between average vote, release year and popularity.
